To adequately utilize the open source skywater130 pdk and understand the design flow, we first require to install all the tools, which are
- open_pdk
- magic
- ngspice
- xschem
- netgen

![toolchains](Resources/Lab1/toolchains.png)

*Note: open_pdk has to be installed last so it can correctly associate the xschem and magic directories.*
*Note: if the configure step fails during any process, its most likely due to missing additional packages, and they need to be installed (preferably from source) to complete the installation*

### Magic
Magic is an open-source VLSI layout tool.<br /><br />
Install steps:
```
$  git clone git://opencircuitdesign.com/magic
$  cd magic
$  ./configure
$  make
$  sudo make install
```
More info can be found at [http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/index.html](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/index.html)

### Netgen
Netgen is a tool for comparing netlists, a process known as LVS, which stands for "Layout vs. Schematic" <br /><br />
Install steps:
```
$  git clone git://opencircuitdesign.com/netgen
$  cd netgen
$  ./configure
$  make
$  sudo make install
```
More info can be found at [http://opencircuitdesign.com/netgen/index.html](http://opencircuitdesign.com/netgen/index.html)

### Xschem
Xschem is a schematic capture program <br /><br />
Install steps:
```
$  git clone https://github.com/StefanSchippers/xschem.git xschem_git
$  cd xchem_git
$  ./configure
$  make
$  sudo make install
```

### Ngspice
ngspice is the open-source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits.<br /><br />
Install steps:<br />

After downloading the tarball from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/) to a local directory, unpack it using:
```
 $ tar -zxvf ngspice-37.tar.gz
 $ cd ngspice-37
 $ mkdir release
 $ cd release
 $ ../configure  --with-x --with-readline=yes --disable-debug
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
```
